# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Using Create React App or your custom solution (React is a must), build an app that:

<!-- - Connects to the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/) -->

<!-- - Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint -->

<!-- - Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit) -->

<!-- - The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required) -->

<!-- - Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera -->

- By default it shows the latest photos for current day

<!-- - Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22) -->

<!-- - Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890) -->

- A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.

Optional:

<!-- - Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted) -->

- We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D

- We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested in seeing how you think and organize a project.

- Please use a linter!


When you finish the test, push it as a public repository in github, gitlab, bitbucket or similar and send us the repository URL.
